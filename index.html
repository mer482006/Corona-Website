               <p class="cn1"> A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous. </p>
               <p class="cn1"> In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.</p>
               <p class="cn1"> COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).</p>

            <div class="c_n"> 
                <p class="h1"> How does the virus spread? </p>
                <p class="cn1"> COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from symptomatic people to others who are in close contact: </p>
                <p class="cn1"> Through respiratory droplets</p>
                <p class="cn1"> By direct contact with infected persons</p>
                <p class="cn1"> By contact with contaminated objects and surfaces.</p>
